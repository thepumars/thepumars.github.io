Research experience
======
**Oct 2022 - September 2023**
Cross-Domain Autonomous Self-Localization Gateway,
Zhigang Shang’s group, Underwater Acoustics Engineering col-
lege, Harbin Engineering University, China, Harbin,China, De-
veloped a buoy gateway device with self-propulsion and self-
localization capabilities for air-sea cross-domain communication
*written the software for the underlying motion control system.*
**September 2024 - Present**
Underwater Optical Visual Guidance, Yuchao Wang’s group,
409 institute, Harbin Engineering University, China, Engaged in
research focused on developing advanced optical guidance sys-
tems for underwater applications., Developing an optical pose
estimation and guidance system reliant on cooperative targets to
achieve docking tasks. This system provides state information
to the control system, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of
underwater vehicle operations during docking procedures.
